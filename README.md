# Chat Application

This project is a feature-rich chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to communicate in real-time with a seamless and intuitive interface. The application is designed to scan and manage folders and files, enabling users to share files effortlessly during conversations.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant communication with WebSocket integration.
- **File Sharing**: Upload and share files directly within the chat.
- **Folder Scanning**: Automatically scans specified folders for files to share.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with modern hooks and state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for API and server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and chat history.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication using Socket.IO.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables for database and WebSocket configuration.
4. Run the application using `npm start` for the frontend and `npm run server` for the backend.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for group chats.
- Implement end-to-end encryption for messages.
- Enhance file scanning capabilities with advanced filters.
